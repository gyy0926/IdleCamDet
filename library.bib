  abstract   = {Hidden cameras in sensitive locations have become an increasing threat to personal privacy all over the world. Because the camera is small and camouflaged, it is difficult to detect the presence of the camera with naked eyes. Existing works on this subject have either only covered using wireless transmission to detect cameras, or using other methods which are cumbersome in practical use. In this paper, we introduce a new direction that leverages the unintentional electromagnetic (EM) emanations of the camera to detect it. We first find that the digital output of the camera's image sensor will be amplitude-modulated to the EM emanations of the camera's clock. Thus, changes in the scope of the camera will directly cause changes in the camera's EM emanations, which constitutes a unique characteristic for a hidden camera. Based on this, we propose a novel camera detection system named CamRadar, which can filter out potential camera EM emanations from numerous EM signals quickly and achieve accurate hidden camera detection. Benefitting from the camera's EM emanations, CamRadar will not be limited by the camera transmission types or the detection angle. Our extensive real-world experiments using CamRadar and 19 hidden cameras show that CamRadar achieves a fast detection (in 16.75s) with a detection rate of 93.23% as well as a low false positive rate of 3.95%.},

  //abstract  = {WiFi-based gesture recognition emerges in recent years and attracts extensive attention from researchers. Recognizing gestures via WiFi signal is feasible because a human gesture introduces a time series of variations to the received raw signal. The major challenge for building a ubiquitous gesture recognition system is that the mapping between each gesture and the series of signal variations is not unique, exact the same gesture but performed at different locations or with different orientations towards the transceivers generates entirely different gesture signals (variations). To remove the location dependency, prior work proposes to use gesture-level location-independent features to characterize the gesture instead of directly matching the signal variation pattern. We observe that gesture-level features cannot fully remove the location dependency since the signal qualities inside each gesture are different and also depends on the location. Therefore, we divide the signal time series of each gesture into segments according to their qualities and propose customized signal processing techniques to handle them separately. To realize this goal, we characterize signal's sensing quality by building a mathematical model that links the gesture signal with the ambient noise, from which we further derive a unique metric i.e., error of dynamic phase index (EDP-index) to quantitatively describe the sensing quality of signal segments of each gesture. We then propose a quality-oriented signal processing framework that maximizes the contribution of the high-quality signal segments and minimizes the impact of low-quality signal segments to improve the performance of gesture recognition applications. We develop a prototype on COTS WiFi devices. The extensive experimental results demonstrate that our system can recognize gestures with an accuracy of more than 94% on average, and significant improvements compared with state-of-arts.},

  //abstract  = {Recently, the spy cameras spotted in private rental places have raised immense privacy concerns. The existing solutions for detecting them require additional support from synchronous external sensing or stimulus hardware such as on/off LED circuits, which require extra obligations from the user. For example, a user needs to carry a smartphone and laboriously perform preset motions (e.g., jumping, waving, and preplanned walking pattern) for synchronous sensing of acceleration signals. These requirements cause considerable discomfort to the user and limit the practicability of prevalent solutions. To cope with this, we propose CSI:DeSpy, an efficient and painless method by leveraging video bitrate fluctuations of the WiFi camera and the passively obtained Channel States Information (CSI) from user motion. CSI:DeSpy includes a self-adaptive feature that makes it robust to detect motion efficiently in multipath-rich environments. We implemented CSI:DeSpy on the Android platform and assessed its performance in diverse real-life scenarios, namely; (1) its reliability with the intensities of physical activities in diverse multipath-rich environments, (2) its practicability with activities of daily living, (3) its unobtrusiveness with passive sensing, and (4) its robustness to different network loads. CSI:DeSpy attained average detection rates of 96.6%, 96.2%, 98.5%, and 93.6% respectively.},

To mitigate these threats, there are both commercial products and research prototypes designed to detect hidden spy cameras in household and office environments. However, existing work often relies heavily on user expertise and only applies to wireless cameras. To bridge this gap, we propose HeatDeCam, a thermal-imagery-based spy camera detector, capable of detecting hidden spy cameras with or without built-in wireless connectivity. To reduce the reliance on user expertise, HeatDeCam leverages a compact neural network deployed on a smartphone to recognize unique heat dissipation patterns of spy cameras. To evaluate the proposed system, we have collected and open-sourced a dataset of a total of 22506 thermal and visual images. These images consist of 11 spy cameras collected from 6 rooms across different environmental conditions. Using this dataset, we found HeatDeCam can achieve over 95% accuracy in detecting hidden cameras. We have also conducted a usability evaluation involving a total of 416 participants using both an online survey and an in-person usability test to validate HeatDeCam.},

  abstract   = {The past decade's research in RF indoor localization has led to technologies with decimeter-level accuracy under controlled experimental settings. However, existing solutions are not reliable in challenging environments with rich multipath and various occlusions. The errors can be 3-5 times compared to settings with clear LoS paths. In addition, when the direct path is completely blocked, such approaches would generate wrong location estimates. In this paper, we present NLoc, a reliable non-line-of-sight localization system that overcomes the above limitations. The key innovation of NLoc is to convert multipath reflections to virtual direct paths to enhance the localization performance. To this end, NLoc first extracts reliable multi-dimensional parameters by characterizing phase variations. Then, it models the relation between the target location and the geometric features of multipath reflections to obtain virtual direct paths. Finally, it incorporates novel algorithms to remove random ToF offsets due to lack of synchronization and compensate target orientation that determines the geometric features, for accurate location estimates. We implement NLoc on commercial off-the-shelf WiFi devices. Our experiments in multipath challenged environments with dozens of obstacles and occlusions demonstrate that NLoc outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by 44% at the median and 200% at 90% percentile.},

对于大多数基于模式匹配的低频解决方案，以往的工作要么是简单接收信号强度(RSS)，因为复杂的环境动力学导致性能显著下降，要么是依赖于细粒度物理层信道状态信息(CSI)，其复杂的结构导致计算复杂度增加。
同时，恶劣的室内环境也会在某些预定义参考点(RPs)之间产生相似的无线电信号，这些信号可能随机分布在感兴趣的区域，从而极大地影响定位制图的精度。
为了解决这些难题，在离线现场调查中，我们首先采用CSI振幅的自回归(AR)建模熵作为位置指纹，该方法在保留最具位置特异性的统计通道信息的同时，具有RSS结构简单的特点。
此外，通过一种增强的基于子空间的算法，可以从CSI阶段准确提取额外的到达角(AoA)指纹，进一步消除了容易出错的RP候选。
在在线阶段，利用CSI的振幅和相位信息，提出了一种新的二元核回归方法来精确推断目标的位置。
大量的室内实验结果验证了我们提出的系统优于以前的方法的定位性能。},

  abstract   = {With the high demand for wireless data traffic, WiFi networks have experienced very rapid growth, because they provide high throughput and are easy to deploy. Recently, Channel State Information (CSI) measured by WiFi networks is widely used for different sensing purposes. To get a better understanding of existing WiFi sensing technologies and future WiFi sensing trends, this survey gives a comprehensive review of the signal processing techniques, algorithms, applications, and performance results of WiFi sensing with CSI. Different WiFi sensing algorithms and signal processing techniques have their own advantages and limitations and are suitable for different WiFi sensing applications. The survey groups CSI-based WiFi sensing applications into three categories, detection, recognition, and estimation, depending on whether the outputs are binary/multi-class classifications or numerical values. With the development and deployment of new WiFi technologies, there will be more WiFi sensing opportunities wherein the targets may go beyond from humans to environments, animals, and objects. The survey highlights three challenges for WiFi sensing: robustness and generalization, privacy and security, and coexistence of WiFi sensing and networking. Finally, the survey presents three future WiFi sensing trends, i.e., integrating cross-layer network information, multi-device cooperation, and fusion of different sensors, for enhancing existing WiFi sensing capabilities and enabling new WiFi sensing opportunities.},

  abstract  = {With the explosion of IoT device use, networks are becoming more vulnerable to attack. Network administrators need better tools to verify and discover these devices in order to minimize attack risk. Existing tools provide rule-based assessment capabilities that cannot keep pace with the proliferation of devices. Current techniques demonstrate that given a rich set of labeled packet traces, one could design a pipeline that identifies all the devices in that trace with over 99% accuracy [30, 32]. However, it has also been observed [25], that such techniques are brittle when no labels are available. More perniciously, they provide false confidence scores about the label they do ascribe to a sample. This paper introduces a probabilistic framework for providing meaningful feedback in device identification, particularly when the device has not been previously observed. In our work, we use stacked autoencoders for automatically learning features from device traffic, learn the classes of traffic observed, and probabilistically model each device as a distribution of traffic classes. Our experiments show that we are able to identify previously seen devices after only 18.9 TCP-flow samples with 100% accuracy for devices where at least 50 samples are observed. We also show that we can distinguish between two broad classes of devices - IoT and Non-IoT - by examining the average number of flow classes observed over a set of samples. Our experiments show that we can infer the correct class of unseen devices with an over 82% average F1 score and 70% accuracy.},

  //abstract  = {Driven by a wide range of real-world applications, significant efforts have recently been made to explore device-free human activity recognition techniques that utilize the information collected by various wireless infrastructures to infer human activities without the need for the monitored subject to carry a dedicated device. Existing device free human activity recognition approaches and systems, though yielding reasonably good performance in certain cases, are faced with a major challenge. The wireless signals arriving at the receiving devices usually carry substantial information that is specific to the environment where the activities are recorded and the human subject who conducts the activities. Due to this reason, an activity recognition model that is trained on a specific subject in a specific environment typically does not work well when being applied to predict another subject's activities that are recorded in a different environment. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose EI, a deep-learning based device free activity recognition framework that can remove the environment and subject specific information contained in the activity data and extract environment/subject-independent features shared by the data collected on different subjects under different environments. We conduct extensive experiments on four different device free activity recognition testbeds: WiFi, ultrasound, 60 GHz mmWave, and visible light. The experimental results demonstrate the superior effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed EI framework.},

  //abstract     = {Accurate localization technology is essential for providing location-based services. Global positioning system (GPS) is a typical localization technology that has been used in various fields. However, various indoor localization techniques are required because GPS signals cannot be received in indoor environments. Typical indoor localization methods use the time of arrival, angle of arrival, or the strength of the wireless communication signal to determine the location. In this paper, we propose an indoor localization scheme using signal strength that can be easily implemented in a smartphone. The proposed algorithm uses a trilateration method to estimate the position of the smartphone. The accuracy of the trilateration method depends on the distance estimation error. We first determine whether the propagation path is line-of-sight (LOS) or non-line-of-sight (NLOS), and distance estimation is performed accordingly. This LOS and NLOS identification method decreases the distance estimation error. The proposed algorithm is implemented as a smartphone application. The experimental results show that distance estimation error is significantly reduced, resulting in accurate localization.},

  //abstract = {Wi-Fi fingerprint based wireless indoor localization has received increasing research attention in recent years. Most existing works utilize the received signal strength (RSS) as the fingerprint of a particular position. However, RSS provides only very coarse-grained property of the received signal and thus cannot achieve high localization accuracy. Recently, some works attempt to improve the localization accuracy of Wi-Fi fingerprinting by utilizing the fine-grained channel state information (CSI) that can be obtained on commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) network interface cards. These studies, however, use only the summation of the received signals to distinguish different positions, which limits their performance gain over the existing RSS-based methods. Our observations show that the distribution of CSI amplitude on individual subcarriers rather than the summation over all subcarriers can provide much finer-grained differentiation among different positions. In this paper, we propose a new localization method that exploits the distribution of CSI as the fingerprint of positions. Our approach makes better use of the frequency diversity with different subcarriers and the spatial diversity with multiple antennas, and thus effectively improves the localization accuracy. The Kullback–Laibler divergence is used to calculate the similarity between different fingerprints, based on which the best matched position is calculated in the localization phase. The experiment results obtained in two typical indoor environments demonstrate that, compared with the state-of-the-art approach, the proposed approach improves localization accuracy by 30%.},

  //abstract  = {Power delay profiles characterize multipath channel features, which are widely used in motion- or localization-based applications. Recent studies show that the power delay profile may be derived from the CSI traces collected from commodity WiFi devices, but the performance is limited by two dominating factors. The resolution of the derived power delay profile is determined by the channel bandwidth, which is however limited on commodity WiFi. The collected CSI reflects the signal distortions due to both the channel attenuation and the hardware imperfection. A direct derivation of power delay profiles using raw CSI measures, as has been done in the literature, results in significant inaccuracy. In this paper, we present Splicer, a software-based system that derives high-resolution power delay profiles by splicing the CSI measurements from multiple WiFi frequency bands. We propose a set of key techniques to separate the mixed hardware errors from the collected CSI measurements. Splicer adapts its computations within stringent channel coherence time and thus can perform well in presence of mobility. Our experiments with commodity WiFi NICs show that Splicer substantially improves the accuracy in profiling multipath characteristics, reducing the errors of multipath distance estimation to be less than $2m$. Splicer can immediately benefit upper-layer applications. Our case study with recent single-AP localization achieves a median localization error of $0.95m$.},

  //abstract  = {The rapid growth of location-based applications has spurred extensive research on localization. Nonetheless, indoor localization remains an elusive problem mostly because the accurate techniques come at the expense of cumbersome war-driving or additional infrastructure. Towards a solution that is easier to adopt, we propose SpinLoc that is free from these requirements. Instead, SpinLoc levies a little bit of the localization burden on the humans, expecting them to rotate around once to estimate their locations. Our main observation is that wireless signals attenuate differently, based on how the human body is blocking the signal. We find that this attenuation can reveal the directions of the APs in indoor environments, ultimately leading to localization. This paper studies the feasibility of SpinLoc in real-world indoor environments using off-the-shelf WiFi hardware. Our preliminary evaluation demonstrates accuracies comparable toschemes that rely on expensive war-driving.},

  //abstract   = {Indoor positioning systems have received increasing attention for supporting location-based services in indoor environments. WiFi-based indoor localization has been attractive due to its open access and low cost properties. However, the distance estimation based on received signal strength indicator (RSSI) is easily affected by the temporal and spatial variance due to the multipath effect, which contributes to most of the estimation errors in current systems. How to eliminate such effect so as to enhance the indoor localization performance is a big challenge. In this work, we analyze this effect across the physical layer and account for the undesirable RSSI readings being reported. We explore the frequency diversity of the subcarriers in OFDM systems and propose a novel approach called FILA, which leverages the channel state information (CSI) to alleviate multipath effect at the receiver. We implement the FILA system on commercial 802.11 NICs, and then evaluate its performance in different typical indoor scenarios. The experimental results show that the accuracy and latency of distance calculation can be significantly enhanced by using CSI. Moreover, FILA can significantly improve the localization accuracy compared with the corresponding RSSI approach.},

Especially, the leakage of images taken by wireless spy cameras in sensitive spaces, such as hotel rooms, Airbnb rentals, public restrooms, and shower rooms, has become a serious privacy concern/threat. To mitigate/address this pressing concern, we propose a Spy Camera Finder (SCamF) that uses ubiquitous smartphones to detect and locate wireless spy cameras by analyzing encrypted Wi-Fi network traffic. Not only by characterizing the network traffic patterns of wireless cameras but also by reconstructing encoded video frame sizes from encrypted traffic, SCamF effectively determines the existence of wireless cameras on the Wi-Fi networks, and accurately verifies whether the thus-detected cameras are indeed recording users’ activities. SCamF also accurately locates spy cameras by analyzing reconstructed video frame sizes. We have implemented SCamF on Android smartphones and evaluated its performance on a real testbed across 20 types of wireless cameras. Our experimental results show SCamF to: (1) classify wireless cameras with an accuracy of 0.98; (2) detect spy cameras among the classified wireless cameras with a true positive rate (TPR) of 0.97; (3) incur low false positive rates (FPRs) of 0 and 0.031 for non-camera devices and cameras not recording the users’ activities, respectively; (4) locate spy cameras with centimeter-level distance errors.},
